title: "Publication: Social dynamics of nonliving dissipative structures"
collection: recent
permalink: /recent/coupled_dissipative_structures
citation: '<b>Publication</b>: Humans are a kind of dissipative structure---that
is, an entity that requires the addition of energy in order to sustain itself.
Recently, Ben de Bari led a project in which we investigated seemingly social
behavior of nonliving dissipative structures, allowing us to explore how much
of our human social dynamics might be explained by the constraints and pressures
of being dissipative structures in shared environments (De Bari, <b>Paxton</b>,
Kondepudi, Kay, & Dixon, 2021, <i>Entropy</i>).'
