## Data-rich human communication

As a cognitive scientist and data scientist, I take a **data-rich approach** to
understanding **how people collaborate, bond, and fight**. To do that, I
weave together a **variety of data sources from the lab and the real world**
for a converging tapestry of the many ways in which our language, movement,
decisions, and emotions change during social contact. Understanding how
context---including conversational goals, social connections, and physical
spaces---shape our emerging behaviors is a primary goal of my research, embedded
within **rich traditions of dynamical and ecological perspectives** on human
behavior and cognition broadly.

I also **develop methods** to quantify social interaction,
promote **open science** research and education, and
create opportunities for cognitive scientists and psychologists who are
interested in **data science, naturally occurring data, and big data**,
with a special focus on **data ethics**. Advocating for **diversity, equity, and inclusion**
is an essential part of my scholarly, mentoring, and pedagogical work.

## About me

I'm an associate professor in the
[University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/)’s
[Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psych.uconn.edu/), specifically
 within the
[Perception, Action, Cognition division](https://psych.uconn.edu/perception-action-cognition-division/).
I am affiliated with
the [Center for the Ecological Study of Perception and Action](https://cespa.uconn.edu/);
the [Institute for Collaboration on Health, Intervention, and Policy](https://chip.uconn.edu/);
the [Connecticut Institute for the Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://ibacs.uconn.edu/);
and the [Cognitive Science program](https://cogsci.uconn.edu/).

I'm proud to lead the [**dyscord lab**](https://dyscord-lab.github.io/).
Together, we explore the
**dy**namics of
**s**ocial
**c**ommunication and
inter-**or**ganism
**d**ependencies.
Our lab currently includes several graduate students ---
[Caitrín ("Cat") Hall](https://psych.uconn.edu/person/caitrin-hall/) (graduating in 2025!),
Gray Thomas,
Lucia Rivas,
and Caleb Owen ---
and a number of bright and hard-working current and former
undergraduate research assistants. You can find out more about our community
and our work [at our lab website](https://dyscord-lab.github.io/). (If you're an
undergraduate student interested in working with the lab, please
[fill out this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=fqjxFyUqqk65351DkDSwgPfhhkOQ2bRMjpFEejI6GYdUMjBRQjRJQUVHRlpMQVlCMllZWk9NRVhLMS4u).)

<!--- **I am actively recruiting graduate students!** If you are interested in
working with me, I encourage you to reach out to me by email. I'd love to hear 
about your interests, how they fit with my lab's interests, and what you might
be passionate about pursuing as part of our community. --->

Previously, I was a postdoctoral scholar working with
[Tom Griffiths](http://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/index.php) in the
[Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences](http://icbs.berkeley.edu/)
at the [University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/)
and a [Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow](http://msdse.org/)
at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](http://bids.berkeley.edu/). I
received my Ph.D in
[Cognitive and Information Sciences](http://cogsci.ucmerced.edu/) working with
[Rick Dale](http://co-mind.org/rick/) at the
[University of California, Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu/).
