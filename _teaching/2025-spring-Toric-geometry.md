Toric varieties provide a rich class of examples in algebraic geometry that bridge combinatorics and geometry, making them an ideal starting point for exploring the interplay between these fields. We will introduce toric varieties, study their combinatorial and abstract structures, and examine their basic geometry, including singularities, Picard groups, and cohomology.

**Schedule.** Thursdays 16:15–18:00, HG E 41.

**Office hours.** Wednesday, 15:30–18:00 or by appointment (office HG J 16.2).

**Prerequisites.** Some background in algebraic geometry is highly desirable. In the absence of an algebraic geometry background, knowledge of at least one of differential, complex, or symplectic geometry is required.
