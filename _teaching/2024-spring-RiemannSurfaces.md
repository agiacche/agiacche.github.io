**Lectures.** Thursdays 16:15–18:00, HG D 5.2. The first lecture is on Thursday, February 22, 2024.

**Office hours.** By appointment (office HG J 16.2).

**Course description.** The course will be a first introduction to Riemann surfaces. These are beautiful objects that sit at the intersection of algebra, geometry, and analysis. We will aim to cover the theorems of Riemann–Hurwitz and Riemann–Roch, as well as the basics of Hurwitz theory. Time permitting, we may delve into additional subjects such as abelian integrals and the Abel–Jacobi theorem. 

**Prerequisites.** Theory of functions of one complex variable, basics of topology. Familiarity with the theory of smooth manifolds and algebraic topology would be useful, but not necessary.
