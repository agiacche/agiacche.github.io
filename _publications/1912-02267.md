The authors show how Masur–Veech volumes of the principal strata of quadratic differentials can be computed as intersection numbers arising from the Segre class of the quadratic Hodge bundle, which can be further simplified to certain linear Hodge integrals. In the appendix, we prove that the intersection of this class with $$\psi$$-classes can be computed by the Eynard–Orantin topological recursion.
