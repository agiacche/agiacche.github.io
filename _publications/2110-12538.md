The volume $$B^{\mathrm{comb}}_{\Sigma}(\mathbb{G})$$ of the unit ball—with respect to the combinatorial length function $$\ell_{\mathbb{G}}$$—of the space of measured foliations on a stable bordered surface $$\Sigma$$ appears as the prefactor of the polynomial growth of the number of multicurves on $$\Sigma$$. We find the range of $$s \in \mathbb{R}$$ for which $$(B^{\mathrm{comb}}_{\Sigma})^s$$, as a function over the combinatorial moduli spaces, is integrable with respect to the Kontsevich measure. The results depends on the topology of $$\Sigma$$, in contrast with the situation for hyperbolic surfaces where Arana-Herrera and Athreya recently proved an optimal square-integrability.
