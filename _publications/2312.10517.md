We study the length of short cycles on uniformly random metric maps (also known as ribbon graphs) of large genus using a Teichm√ºller theory approach. We establish that, as the genus tends to infinity, the length spectrum converges to a Poisson point process with an explicit intensity. This result extends the work of Janson and Louf to the multi-faced case.
