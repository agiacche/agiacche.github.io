We study the intersection theory of the $$\Theta^{r,s}$$-classes, where $$r \geq 2$$ and $$1 \leq s \leq r - 1$$, which are cohomological field theories arising as the top-degree parts of Chiodo classes. We show that generalised topological recursion on the $$(r,s)$$ spectral curves computes the descendant integrals of the $$\Theta$$-classes. Consequently, we prove that the descendant potential of the $$\Theta$$-classes is a tau function of the $$r$$-KdV hierarchy, generalising the Brézin–Gross–Witten tau function (the special case $$r = 2, s = 1$$). We also explicitly compute the $$\mathcal{W}$$-constraints satisfied by the descendant potential, given by differential representations of the $$\mathcal{W}(\mathfrak{gl}_r)$$-algebra at self-dual level. This work extends previously known results on the Witten $$r$$-spin class, the $$r$$-spin $$\Theta$$-classes (corresponding to $$s = r - 1$$), and the Norbury $$\Theta$$-classes (the case $$r = 2, s = 1$$).
