In this paper, we present a novel approach for computing the large genus asymptotics of intersection numbers. Our strategy is based on a resurgent analysis of the \\(n\\)-point functions of such intersection numbers, which are computed via determinantal formulae, and relies on the presence of a quantum curve. With this approach, we are able to extend the recent results of Aggarwal for Witten-Kontsevich intersection numbers with the computation of all subleading corrections, proving a conjecture of Guo-Yang, and to obtain new results on \\(r\\)-spin and Theta-class intersection numbers.
