We construct and study various properties of a negative spin version of the Witten $$r$$-spin class. By taking the top Chern class of a certain vector bundle on the moduli space of stable twisted spin curves, we construct a non-semisimple cohomological field theory that we call the Theta class $$\Theta^r$$. This CohFT does not have a flat unit and its associated Dubrovin‚ÄìFrobenius manifold is nowhere semisimple.

Despite this, we construct a semisimple deformation of the Theta class, and using the Teleman reconstruction theorem, we obtain tautological relations on the moduli space of stable curves. We further consider the descendant potential of $$\Theta^r$$ and prove that it is the unique solution to a set of $$\mathcal{W}$$-algebra constraints, which implies a recursive formula for the descendant integrals.

Using this result for $$r = 2$$, we prove Norbury's conjecture, which states that the descendant potential of the Theta class coincides with the Br√©zin‚ÄìGross‚ÄìWitten tau function of the KdV hierarchy. Furthermore, we conjecture that the descendant potential of $$\Theta^r$$ is the $$r$$-BGW tau function of the $$r$$-KdV hierarchy, and we prove the conjecture for $$r = 3$$.
