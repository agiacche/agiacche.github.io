We study the spin Gromov–Witten (GW) theory of \\(\mathbb{P}^1\\). Using the standard torus action on \\(\mathbb{P}^1\\), we prove that the associated equivariant potential can be expressed by means of operator formalism and satisfies the 2-BKP hierarchy. As a consequence of this result, we prove the spin analogue of the Gromov–Witten/Hurwitz correspondence of Okounkov–Pandharipande for \\(\mathbb{P}^1\\), which was conjectured by J. Lee. Finally, we prove that this correspondence for a general target spin curve follows from a conjectural degeneration formula for spin Gromov–Witten invariants that holds in virtual dimension 0.
