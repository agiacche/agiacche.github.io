We show that the $$n$$-point, genus-$$g$$ correlation functions of topological recursion on any regular spectral curve with simple ramifications grow at most like $$(2g)!$$ as $$g \to \infty$$, which is the expected growth rate. This provides, in particular, an upper bound for many curve counting problems in large genus and serves as a preliminary step for a resurgence analysis.
